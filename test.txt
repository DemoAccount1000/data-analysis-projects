Repository (repo): A storage space for your project files, code, and history. Think of it like a project folder.

Commit: A saved change in your repository. Each commit records what was changed and lets you go back to earlier versions if needed.

Branch: A separate version of your repository where you can make changes without affecting the main code. Usually the main branch is called main or master.

Merge: Combining changes from one branch into another, usually bringing new features or fixes into the main branch.

Pull Request (PR): A request to merge changes from your branch into another branch. Other people can review your changes before approving.

Issue: A way to track tasks, bugs, or feature requests in a repository. It helps organize work and collaborate with others.
